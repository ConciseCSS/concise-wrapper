Use this if you need the whole package to start building something. However, it will also get you a lot of extra code that you might not use, is recommended to install only the required packages after you finish your project.

## Installation

```
npm install concise-wrapper
```

```scss
@import 'node_modules/concise-wrapper/concise';
```
